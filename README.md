# Groove Modeler

Generate rhythmic feel by manipulating laid back (behind the beat or ahead of), soft to hard [swing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swing_(jazz_performance_style)), velocity and amplification, tight to drunk precision, random deviation/error and other parameters relevant to the creation of [groove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groove_(music)). More on the [project homepage](https://github.com/fritzfeger/groove-modeler-website).

For the time being the project conisists in [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi "Sonic Pi") prototypes exploring ways to create grooves with parameterized timing.

Goal 1: generic copy and paste Sonic Pi code which can be used in any Sonic Pi song to make it groove

Goal 1: viability for music creation/production with digital audio workstations like Logic Pro - an app which is capable of exporting MIDI for import as groove pattern

## Getting Started

Install [Sonic Pi](https://github.com/samaaron/sonic-pi "Sonic Pi"), copy the code in any one `.rb` file to a free buffer and hit run. Play around with the values.
